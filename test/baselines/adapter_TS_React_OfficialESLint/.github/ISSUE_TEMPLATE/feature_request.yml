        **Thank you for wanting to suggest a feature for this adapter!**


        Please note that feature requests should be about new functionality or improvements
        to the adapter itself.


        Before submitting, please check if:

        - The feature already exists in the latest version

        - There is already an open issue for this feature

        - This is about the adapter and not about ioBroker core functionality


        For general questions or support, please use the
        [ioBroker forum at forum.iobroker.net](https://forum.iobroker.net/).


        Thank you for your collaboration!
