        **Thank you for wanting to report a bug in this adapter!**


        If this is the first time you are doing this, please take a few moments to read
        through the adapter documentation.


        You are about to report a bug in this adapter. Do not proceed if your issue
        occurs with ioBroker core, any third party adapters, unofficial or outdated
        adapter versions.


        Do also not seek support here ("I need help with ...", "I have a
        question ...", "Can someone walk me through ..."), that belongs into the
        [ioBroker forum at forum.iobroker.net](https://forum.iobroker.net/).


        And finally, make sure any bug you want to report is still present with the **current**
        adapter version.


        Thank you for your collaboration!
