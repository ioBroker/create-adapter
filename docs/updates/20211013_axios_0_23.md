# Update of axios > 0.21

This migration is only required if you are using TypeScript.

## Update to the latest version of axios

In your adapter directory run the following command to ensure you have the latest version of axios:

```bash
npm i axios@latest
```

## Update calls to axios

Wherever you called `axios(...)` in your code, you need to replace this with `axios.request<any>(...)`.

The only place where such code is generated by create-adapter is in `lib/tools.ts` in the two functions `translateYandex()` and `translateGoogle()`.

You might have other places where you used axios, make sure you update all of them.

## Better than `any`

For your own code you might want to consider using a real type (e.g. an interface) as the response type of the axios request (instead of `any`). This will make your code more understandable and help you spot issues which would be hidden by using `any`.
