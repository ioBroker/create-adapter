# Support for Typescript 4.4 and going forward

TypeScript does not follow semantic versioning, so every minor update usually contains breaking changes. To mitigate this, the TypeScript dependency should be switched to `~` versions, which only include patch updates. This is done by changing the `package.json` file as follows:

```diff
-    "typescript": "^4.4.2",
+    "typescript": "~4.4.2",
```

In the case of TypeScript 4.4, `catch` variables are now by default typed as `unknown` instead of `any`, causing some build errors:

```ts
try {
    ...
} catch (e) {
      // ^ was `any`, is now `unknown`
}
```

If you already upgraded or generated an adapter with a previous version of the creator and your build is failing as a result, you will need to do the following changes to be compatible with TypeScript 4.4:

1. _(JS with type checking only)_: in `tsconfig.json`, add `"useUnknownInCatchVariables": false` inside the `compilerOptions` section:

    ```diff
             // "noUnusedParameters": true,
    +        "useUnknownInCatchVariables": false,
    ```

2. _(TS only)_: You have several options:

    1. Revert to the old behavior by adding `"useUnknownInCatchVariables": false` in `tsconfig.json`

    1. Add additional checks to make sure you're not treating `e` as something it is not, for example:

        ```ts
        try {
        	//...
        } catch (e) {
        	if (e instanceof Error) {
        		console.error(e.message);
        	} else {
        		// ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
        	}
        }
        ```

    1. Annotate the catch variables as `any` where errors are thrown. This can be selectively combined with the previous solution.
        ```ts
        try {
        	//...
        } catch (e: any) {
        	//    ^^^^^
        	// handle error as before
        }
        ```

3. _(TS only)_: Edit `src/lib/tools.ts` as follows (in two locations):
    ```diff
    - } catch (e) {
    + } catch (e: any) {
          throw new Error(`Could not translate to "${targetLang}": ${e}`);
      }
    ```
