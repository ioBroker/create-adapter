## Prerequisites

Any computer with NodeJS in version 12 or higher and npm 6 or higher. Note that the created adapters or ioBroker itself may have different requirements.

## Usage

This tool is not supposed to be installed. Instead, run the most recent version using

```
npx @iobroker/create-adapter [options]
```

in the directory where the directory of your project should be created. You don't need to create the adapter/widget directory, because it will be created for you.
**WARNING:** If the path contains a space, this [won't work](https://github.com/npm/npx/issues/14).

After a short while, you will be asked a few questions. Afterwards all the necessary files will be created for you.

### Options

The following CLI options are available:

-   `--target=/path/to/dir` - Specify which directory the adapter files should be created in (instead of the current dir). Shortcut: `-t`
-   `--skipAdapterExistenceCheck` - Don't check if an adapter with the same name already exists on `npm`. Shortcut: `-x`
-   `--replay=/path/to/file` - Re-run the adapter creator with the answers of a previous run (the given file needs to be the `.create-adapter.json` in the root of the previously generated directory). Shortcut: `-r`
-   `--migrate=/path/to/dir` - Run the adapter creator with the answers pre-filled from an existing adapter directory (the given path needs to point to the adapter base directory where `io-package.json` is found). Shortcut: `-m`

All CLI options can also be [provided as environment variables](https://yargs.js.org/docs/#api-reference-envprefix) by prepending `CREATE_ADAPTER_`. Example: `CREATE_ADAPTER_TARGET=/tmp/iobroker/create-adapter/`

### Environment variables

Besides all environment variables mentioned above under "Options" the following variables change the behavior of the application:

-   `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` - if this is pointing to a valid JSON file, the Google API v3 will be used for translations, make sure that the credentials are allowed to use the Google Translation API. Check [the documentation](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/setup) for more details.

## Developing

First of all: **DO NOT** push changes to `master` directly! Just don't. Every change should be done through PRs, which have a template with a checklist to fill out.
This makes sure that `master` always works and every change is documented.

For developers of this package, there are a few things to know:

-   `npm run build` creates a fresh build and deletes old build files. This is necessary when template files are renamed or deleted, as the compiled files will still be there.
-   `npm run watch` keeps compiling incremental changes whenever you save a source file.
-   The directory `/templates` contains a bunch of templates, which are basically TypeScript files exporting a single method:
    -   This method accepts an object with the user's answers and returns a `string` or `Promise<string>` containing the output file.
    -   The last extension (`.ts`) is removed when creating the output file. Setting the `customPath` property of the template method allows you to override the output path of the file, either a constant or depending on the user's answers (function).
    -   The outputted files are automatically formatted to have the correct indentation and multiple empty lines are removed. If you don't want this, set `noReformat` to true.
-   Test your changes with `npm test` and/or write relevant tests. For a couple of representative combination of answers, baseline adapter directories are generated. If those baselines are changed as a result of your changes, please review if those changes are desired.

## Publishing

Do not publish directly using `npm`. Instead create a new release with the release script `npm run release ...`. This creates a tag on github, performs a test run on Github Actions and after a successful build automatically publishes to npm.

You can semantically increase the version and publish it by using

```bash
npm run release [<releaseType> [<postfix>]] [-- --dry]
```

(preferably) or set a specific version by using

```bash
npm run release <version> [-- --dry]
```

The option `-- --dry` (don't forget the first pair of dashes) performs a dry run without updating files.
The available release types are:

-   `major`
-   `premajor`
-   `minor`
-   `preminor`
-   `patch`
-   `prepatch`
-   `prerelease`

and the `pre-...` versions allow you to append a postfix like `-beta`.
